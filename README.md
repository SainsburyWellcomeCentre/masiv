# goggleViewer README and Quickstart#


### What does goggleViewer do? ###

*goggleViewer is an experimental image viewer, designed for large (>100GB) 3D image datasets.
*It works by creating a downsampled stack, which is then navigated as you would a regular 3D image stack. 
*However, the program pulls data from the hard disk to a cache when zoomed in, allowing all the original detail to be viewed
*A plugin class can be easily subclassed to create user-defined plugins. For example, a cell counter plugin is included.
