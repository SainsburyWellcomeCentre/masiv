This directory contains functions that are used by both
masiv and the abstract class, masiv_plugin. This is needed
because we want to be able to run masiv_plugin independently
of masiv. masiv_plugin performs tasks like installing and
removing external plugins. External plugins are those that are
not bundled with MaSIV.
