### What does goggleViewer do? ###

goggleViewer is an experimental image viewer, designed for large (>100GB) 3D image datasets.
It works by creating a downsampled stack, which is then navigated as you would a regular 3D image stack. However, the program pulls data from the hard disk to a cache when zoomed in, allowing all the original detail to be viewed
